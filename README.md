# DND-Creator
Text-based DND Character Creator

#About Me
This project is meant to be a text-based application that helps with creating DND-like characters with classes, weapons, stats, genders and races included.
Eventually this project will expand to include gameplay that allows you to take characters created in this and run through various adventure scenarios with them.


#Testing Purposes
Currently, Eclipse is used to run the code. JDK in the console has trouble handling the packaging, but Eclipse can compile and run successfully.
Once the project has reached the point where it is ready to be tested, I will update the .exe so that it can be ran within one file.
